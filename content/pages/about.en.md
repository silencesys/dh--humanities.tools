# Who is behind this?

My name is [Martin Roƒçek](https://rocek.dev), I'm web developer, illustrator and student of history at the Faculty of Arts, Charles University in Prague.

I created humanities.tools because I always wanted to have site where anyone from humanities could fint tools for their research.

I was also greatly influenced by website called [illustration.tools](https://illustration.tools/) built by Magoz. I'm sure you recognize the amount of
inspiration I've borrowed from it. _I hope Magoz won't be angry._ üôÇ

My goal is to further improve the platform by adding new tools and features. So, if you have any ideas how to improve it or you want to contribute, please, let me know on my email.
